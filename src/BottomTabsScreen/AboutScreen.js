              Carbon credits are a fundamental tool in the fight against climate
              change. They represent a quantifiable unit of carbon dioxide
              emissions that have been reduced, avoided, or sequestered by a
              specific project or initiative. By purchasing carbon credits,
              individuals and companies can offset their own carbon emissions
              and contribute to projects that have a positive impact on the
              environment.
